Dear Leandro, although we have experienced many hardships in our relationship, you have always been resilient in ensuring that our relationship continues to thrive. You have waited for me in my times of insecurity (which are definitely still occurring). You have been empathetic and understanding (in most situations). Despite my continuous agressions, you work past that because of your love for me, and I could not be more grateful. 

I have created this "website" to vaguely express my love to you in a format that you would appreciate, considering you're awesome at breaking apart computers and downloading ROM hacks, haha. In this love letter, I will not be giving names of certain people, locations, and situations that can be traced back to us (hopefully).
